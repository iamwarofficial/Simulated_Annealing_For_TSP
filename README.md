# Simulated Annealing For TSP
 
 The developer has implemented the simulated annealing algorithm into the Java Platform. To make the trials fair, the author used the same number of US-based cities. The distance between each city is identified by its latitude and longitudes coordinates. The Haversine formula is used to calculate distances between cities. The Haversine formula calculates the shortest distance between two points on a sphere using their latitudes and longitudes measured along the surface. It is essential for use in navigation.

 Following with the simulated annealing algorithm, it started with a random route and getting a random number for the route, when the number smaller and equal to the probability function then it will proceed to adjacent route. If the adjoining route is larger than the current route, it will still proceed to the next route until it gets the shortest adjacent route. If the random number is larger than the probability of function, it will stay in the same route until it reaches the shortest route to follow by the iteration. The program will end when it is no more probability of function as well as a result shows the shortest route. The shortest distance that the authors found from this algorithm is 6994 miles
