The simulated annealing algorithm started with a random route and got a random number for the route. When the number is smaller and equal to the probability function, it will proceed to the adjacent route. If the adjoining route is larger than the current route, it will still proceed to the next route until it gets the shortest adjacent route. If the random number is larger than the probability of function, it will stay in the same route until it reaches the shortest route to follow by the iteration. The program will end when it is no more probability of function, and a result shows the shortest route. The shortest distance that the authors found from this algorithm is 6994 miles.
